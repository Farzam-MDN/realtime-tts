realtime-tts is an application that converts your text into speech right after the enter key is pressed. It does not yet support realtime conversion of text to speech

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need the following in order to run the application as it is intended on your machine:

```
An internet connection
Python 3 or above
Pip package installer for python
```

### Installing the application

First clone this repository or download it manually to a working directory on your computer.
Thereafter, open terminal/cmd inside the realtime-tts directory on your computer.
Now Run the following command in your terminal/cmd:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After all the requirements are installed, you need to download a Chrome WebDriver. Go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads or simply click [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
Now download the latest version of Chrome WebDriver. Extract the downloaded zip file downloaded. Now copy the extracted file (named 'chromedriver.exe') and paste it into 'realtime-tts/chromedriver' directory. Lastly update your chrome browser to the latest version available (this step is highly suggested for better performance of the tool).



### Running the application 

if you have gone through the steps of "Installing the application" chapter, you are ready to use the realtime-tts tool. Open cmd/terminal in the realtime-tts directory and run the following command:

```
py realtime-tts.py
```

The application will run the chrome browser.
Now wait about 10 seconds and then you will see the terminal/cmd. 
The terminal/cmd will prompt you to type a text and press enter.
Type anything you want to turn into speech and press enter. 
Now wait about 1 second and you should here the text being spoken by the application.
You have now successfuly setup and run the application!
